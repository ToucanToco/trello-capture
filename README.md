# Trello Capture

Chrome extension that lets you take a screenshot of your web browser, create a Trello card and attach the screenshot to it in literally two clicks. Bug reporting made easy.

All the heavy lifting is done (taking a screenshot, displaying it in another page, sending it to Trello). Now this needs some product work to become fully usable.
